=======
INSTRUCTIONS (for Insert/Add Image):

Sprint 2 contains the source code, GUI and executable file for an "Insert/Add Image" for this Image to Text recognition. The image recognition part is incomplete but executable and still needs to fix some problems.

Executable file is located on the the "dist" folder. The sample image is also provided named as "robtest.png"
